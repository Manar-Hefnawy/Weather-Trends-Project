# Weather Trends Project

### Project Aim:
analyzing Atlanta and global temperature data and comparing the temperature trends between them to gain new insights

### Data overview:
This project include extracting the data from a database using SQL queries and opening the extracted
data by excel to analyze it and visualize it using a line chart and make observations
about the similarities and differences between the world averages and your Atlantaâ€™s averages, as well as overall trends.

### Observations:
The following observations were noticed as an outcome of the analysis:
   - As regarding to Atlanta the average temperature has decreased rapidly followed by increase twice between 1776 and 1790 & between 1805 and 1832.
   - As regarding to the overall global temperature average there was one noticeable rapid decrease followed by rapid increase between 1805 and 1829.
   - The Atlanta as well as the overall temperature trends have been continuously increasing over the last 50 years.
   - Atlanta is hotter on average compared to the global average.
   - The minimum average in Atlanta was recorded 1779 while the minimum global average was recorded in 1752.
   - The maximum average in Atlanta was recorded in 1828 while the maximum global average was recorded in 2007.
   - The correlation coefficient of the Atlanta average temperature over the years is weak positive(0.38) while the correlation coefficient of the global average temperature over the years is moderate positive (0.62).
